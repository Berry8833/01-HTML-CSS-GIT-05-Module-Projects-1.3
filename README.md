# Create Run Buddy page

* First, write the anchor tag and heading RUN BUDDY in the herader h1.

* Inside, I write tags like navigation/ unordered list/ list/ anchor and what we do/ what you do/ meet the trainers and reach out.

* Yes, this time I will add five sections inside.

* Those sections are hero/jumbotron, what we do, what you do, meet the trainers and reach out.

* Now I have added the hero section. A form is built inside.

* I gave the class name hero-form in a div tag. And inside that I write a header with h3 tag and a paragraph with a p tag.

* Yes, below that, write the tags such as label input for the hero form and your name/ your email address and a telephone number.

* On the radio button, I wrote "have you worked out with a trainer before". I also added a checkbox and wrote that it asks if you are 18 years old. I wrote a submit form to "Get Running!". 

* Finally, write the footer section.

* I wrote made with love by Run Buddy and h2 tag inside.

* In the div tag, I wrote the anchor element and read our privacy policy.

Thank you.
